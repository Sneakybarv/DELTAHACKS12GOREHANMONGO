## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Upload with Valid Receipt
**Steps:**
1. Use a clear receipt image
2. Upload via `/upload` page
3. **Expected:** Data extracted successfully, redirect to review

**Sample Test Image:** Use any grocery receipt (JPG, PNG, WebP)

### Test 2: Review and Edit
**Steps:**
1. After upload, check extracted items
2. Edit an item name or price
3. Click "Generate Health Insights"
4. **Expected:** Updated data sent to Gemini for analysis

### Test 3: Health Insights
**Steps:**
1. Complete upload and review
2. View results page
3. Click text-to-speech button
4. **Expected:** AI reads health insights aloud

### Test 4: Error Handling
**Steps:**
1. Stop backend server
2. Try to upload
3. **Expected:** Clear error message with instructions

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to upload receipt"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set
grep GEMINI_API_KEY backend/.env
```

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds. Backend has 50 req/min limit per IP.

### Issue: Frontend redirects to /upload
**Reason:** This is intentional! If you directly visit `/review` or `/results` without uploading first, it redirects you back to upload.

### Issue: Empty data on review page
**Check:**
1. Did Gemini successfully extract data?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check backend terminal for Gemini API errors
